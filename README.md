## Overview

RedDino leverages a modified Dinov2 framework tailored for RBC morphology analysis. Key contributions include:

- **Dedicated Foundation Model:** Optimized for RBC analysis with robust feature representations.
- **Extensive Dataset:** Trained on over 1.25 million RBC images from 18 diverse datasets spanning various imaging modalities and staining techniques.
- **Rigorous Evaluation:** Comprehensive ablation studies and benchmarking against state-of-the-art models demonstrate significant improvements in classification and shape analysis tasks.
- **Visualization Tools:** PCA and UMAP visualizations reveal the modelâ€™s ability to differentiate between healthy, pathological, and agglomerated cells.
